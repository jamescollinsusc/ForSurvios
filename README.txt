This project is a virtual reality racquetball game made in Unreal Engine 4.18, and intended to be used with the Oculus Rift.

The folder RacquetballPackaged contains a packaged version of the game that is ready to be played, and the folder 
RacquetballFullPproject contains the full unreal project I used to develop the game.

In the game you play against the AI to keep a rally going. Score is kept on the wall you need to hit the ball against.

Have fun!

Sincerely,
James Collins
